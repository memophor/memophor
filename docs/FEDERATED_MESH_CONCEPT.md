## 1. Overview
The **Federated Knowledge Mesh (FKM)** is Memophor’s architectural model for a
distributed, self-organizing network of knowledge nodes.
Each node—whether a Knowlemesh tenant, SynaGraph instance, or Scedge PoP—
maintains local memory while synchronizing meaning, not data, with trusted peers.

The result is a *semantic mesh* that eliminates the need for a central router or
monolithic database while preserving consistency, compliance, and low latency.

---

## 2. Motivation
AI systems and organizations require context continuity without surrendering data
ownership or privacy.  
A federated design provides:

- **Local control** – each tenant governs its own graph and policy.  
- **Global continuity** – knowledge propagates through context capsules (CCP).  
- **Fault tolerance** – loss of a node does not break global memory.  
- **Regulatory compliance** – no single global datastore to subpoena or breach.

---

## 3. Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Federation over Centralization** | No global router in the data path. Knowlemesh Cloud acts only as a registry and policy verifier. |
| **Semantic Routing** | Queries and capsules route by *meaning* and *policy*, not by static network address. |
| **Local First** | Nodes answer from local SynaGraph or Scedge before reaching out to peers. |
| **Policy-Scoped Propagation** | Each knowledge edge carries tenant, region, and compliance metadata. |
| **Eventual Consistency** | Mesh achieves convergence through signed graph-event replay (not distributed transactions). |

## 5. Components

### 5.1 Local Node (Data Plane)
Each participant hosts:

- **SynaGraph Core** – local knowledge graph, vector index, temporal memory.  
- **Scedge PoP** – edge cache for fast response and capsule relay.  
- **CCP Gateway** – exports and imports context capsules.  

### 5.2 Control Plane (Knowlemesh Cloud)
- Registry of nodes, tenants, and their public keys.  
- Policy validation service (who can share with whom).  
- Discovery API returning signed peer manifests.  
- Optional analytics and monitoring (out-of-band).  

### 5.3 Communication Layer
- Capsules exchanged via **CCP over HTTPS/gRPC**.  
- Optional **MCP transport binding** for runtime LLM integration.  
- Each capsule signed (Ed25519) and optionally encrypted (AES-GCM).  

---

## 6. Routing & Discovery

### 6.1 Peer Discovery
Nodes discover peers by:
1. Querying the Knowlemesh Registry (`GET /peers?tenant=...`)  
2. Receiving peer manifests during capsule exchange (`peer_list` field).  
3. Optional gossip or DHT plugin for open networks.

### 6.2 Routing Logic
When a query or capsule is issued:

1. Node checks **local SynaGraph / Scedge**.  
2. If miss → consults local routing table (peers by topic, trust score, latency).  
3. Sends capsule or query to peer(s) most semantically relevant.  
4. Aggregates results → returns context or answer.  

Routing decisions are guided by:
- Topic embeddings
- Policy constraints
- Historical trust & latency metrics

## 7. Synchronization Model

| Event Type | Example | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| `UPSERT` | New node or edge | Write locally, emit delta to authorized peers |
| `SUPERSEDE` | Old answer replaced | Emit purge to Scedge + propagate new link |
| `DECAY` | Node relevance drops below threshold | Update weight, optional broadcast |
| `REVOKE_CAPSULE` | Tenant revocation | Purge capsule and linked edges globally |

Each event is signed and appended to a local **event log**; peers pull and replay
events asynchronously to achieve eventual consistency.

---

## 8. Security & Trust

- **Tenant PKI:** each tenant holds a key pair; registry distributes public keys.  
- **Signed Events:** every graph mutation and capsule export includes signature.  
- **Encrypted Payloads:** sensitive data AES-GCM per tenant or per capsule.  
- **Policy Enforcement:** Knowlemesh validates before issuing peer tokens.  
- **Audit Trail:** immutable event log for provenance and compliance review.

---

## 9. Observability

- **Telemetry Bus:** nodes emit metrics to regional aggregators (optional).  
- **Health Check:** `/healthz` endpoint for PoPs and graphs.  
- **Distributed Tracing:** correlation IDs propagate through capsule headers.  
- **Analytics:** control plane aggregates anonymized stats (hit rates, latency, sync lag).

## 10. Advantages of Federation

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Scalability** | Add nodes or tenants without re-architecting. |
| **Resilience** | No single point of failure; edges reroute around outages. |
| **Latency** | Local data serves most queries. |
| **Privacy & Compliance** | Each tenant controls its memory footprint and sharing policy. |
| **Extensibility** | Supports hybrid deployments: on-prem + cloud + edge. |

---

## 11. Comparison to Centralized Memory Network

| Feature | Centralized | Federated Knowledge Mesh |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Control | Single operator | Distributed tenants |
| Fault tolerance | Limited | High |
| Compliance | Harder to isolate tenants | Tenant-scoped |
| Latency | Dependent on data center | Localized |
| Scalability | Vertical | Horizontal |
| Innovation pace | Slower | Parallel development |

---

## 12. Future Research Areas

| Topic | Goal |
|-------|------|
| **Trust scoring** | Weight peer reliability via signed feedback. |
| **Dynamic topology** | Allow nodes to self-organize by topic and latency. |
| **CRDT/Delta-Graph models** | Formalize conflict resolution. |
| **Zero-trust capsules** | Encrypted sharing with proof-of-access. |
| **Edge learning** | Train lightweight models on local knowledge to pre-answer queries. |

## 13. Summary

The **Federated Knowledge Mesh** transforms Memophor from a single-tenant system
into a *global memory fabric* for AI.  
Each node retains sovereignty yet participates in a collective intelligence
through signed, policy-aware context exchange.  
Routing is semantic, synchronization is eventual, and the system as a whole is
resilient, privacy-preserving, and self-optimizing.

> **In essence:** the world’s knowledge infrastructure evolves from centralized
> data lakes to a federated, living graph of understanding.
