# 🚀 Memophor Platform Roadmap  
> Revision: October 18, 2025  
> Status: Active Research & Development

---

## 1. Overview
The Memophor roadmap tracks progress across the **open-source core**, **commercial orchestration**, and **research initiatives** that together form the **Federated Knowledge Mesh**.  
Each milestone expands the ecosystem toward a self-optimizing, policy-aware, and globally distributed memory network for AI.

## 2. Component Roadmaps

### 🧠 **SynaGraph (Core Engine)**
> The open-source synaptic graph and temporal memory engine.

**Current Focus**
- Build next-gen persistent graph store (RocksDB + PostgreSQL hybrid).  
- Integrate **vector search** (HNSW / DiskANN) with semantic scoring.  
- Implement **temporal decay scheduler** and reinforcement API.  
- Expose provenance, supersede, and audit logic via gRPC + REST.  
- Benchmark large-scale federation scenarios (100M+ nodes).  

**Next**
- Add **CRDT/Delta-Graph synchronization** for federated replication.  
- Implement **adaptive graph compression** for long-term retention.  
- Publish **SynaGraph SDKs** (Rust, Python, Ruby).  

---

### 🕸️ **Knowlemesh (Control Plane)**
> The orchestration and policy layer that governs the mesh.

**Current Focus**
- Multi-tenant Rails control plane for policies, tokens, and credentials.  
- Orchestration workflows for cluster lifecycle and backup automation.  
- Analytics pipelines (Prometheus + Grafana) and audit exports.  
- Integration with billing and compliance (SOC2, HIPAA).  

**Next**
- Add **Federation Registry** for node discovery and tenant PKI.  
- Enable **policy-scoped data sharing** and **cross-tenant capsule exchange**.  
- Expand **observability dashboards** with latency and token-savings analytics.  

---

### ⚡ **Scedge (Edge Layer)**
> Smart Cache on the Edge — a semantic, policy-aware CDN for knowledge.

**Current Focus**
- Implement Rust-based PoP service with Redis/SQLite cache backends.  
- Integrate ANN search for near-duplicate matching.  
- Connect to event bus for graph-aware invalidation (`SUPERSEDED_BY`).  
- Deploy observability stack (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry).  

**Next**
- Add **edge template caching** and **context capsule prewarming**.  
- Enable **secure multi-tenant PoPs** with policy encryption.  
- Prototype **Edge Learning Models** to perform rephrasing and summarization locally.  
- Conduct **GPU cost-reduction benchmarks** across PoPs.  

---

### 🧬 **SeTGIN (Self-Tuning Graph Intelligence Network)**
> The adaptive intelligence loop that learns and optimizes from usage.

**Current Focus**
- Deploy **PerfPolicy controllers** within each SynaGraph node.  
- Implement telemetry bus collecting latency, recall, and freshness metrics.  
- Launch **federated training aggregator** inside Knowlemesh Cloud.  

**Next**
- Integrate **Reinforcement Learning for PerfPolicy tuning**.  
- Enable **cross-tenant transfer learning** for performance sharing.  
- Research **Predictive Edge Warming** (pre-caching with workload forecasts).  
- Publish SeTGIN results in academic venues (VLDB / USENIX / NeurIPS).  

---

### 🧩 **Context Capsule Protocol (CCP)**
> The open standard for AI-to-AI context exchange.

**Current Focus**
- Finalize **v0.1 JSON schema** and API spec (`/capsules`, `/revoke`, `/query`).  
- Implement reference libraries in Rust, Python, and Ruby.  
- Integrate capsule export/import into SynaGraph and Scedge.  

**Next**
- Add **binary encodings** (CBOR / Protobuf) for high throughput.  
- Define **zero-trust capsule encryption** and signature validation.  
- Publish **v1.0 spec** under the Memophor Open Standards Foundation.

### ✨ Summary

Memophor’s platform is evolving from a single knowledge engine into a **living, adaptive intelligence fabric**.  
Each milestone expands the mesh’s autonomy—moving from data storage → semantic understanding → self-optimization → global federation.

> **2025–2028 Goal:**  
> Deliver a decentralized, self-optimizing Knowledge Mesh that makes AI systems continuously learn, share, and remember.
