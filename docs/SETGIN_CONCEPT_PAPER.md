## Abstract

**SeTGIN (Self-Tuning Graph Intelligence Network)** is Memophor‚Äôs adaptive intelligence layer for the **Federated Knowledge Mesh**.  
It transforms the static SynaGraph engine into a living system that continuously monitors its performance, learns from telemetry, and optimizes itself in real time.

By analyzing query latency, cache efficiency, and data freshness, SeTGIN autonomously adjusts graph parameters, decay constants, and caching policies‚Äîmaintaining sub-second responses while minimizing cost and compute waste.  
In the long term, SeTGIN allows every node in the Knowledge Mesh to evolve like a neural network: learning how to serve knowledge faster, smarter, and cheaper.

## 1. Introduction

Knowledge graphs and AI memory systems are typically static. Their parameters‚Äîindex size, search depth, scoring weights‚Äîare manually tuned and rarely updated, leading to performance drift and inefficiency.

In Memophor‚Äôs architecture, the data itself is **alive**.  
Each node of the mesh (SynaGraph + Scedge PoP) produces telemetry about usage, latency, and precision.  
**SeTGIN** consumes this telemetry to **self-optimize** both local and global behavior.

The result is a federated network that *learns from its own usage*.

## 2. Motivation

| Problem | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Manual tuning bottleneck** | Administrators cannot manually adjust parameters for thousands of nodes. |
| **Dynamic workloads** | Query volume, model versions, and tenants shift continuously. |
| **Heterogeneous infrastructure** | Each node operates under different latency and compliance constraints. |
| **Performance drift** | Static settings degrade over time as the graph evolves. |

SeTGIN eliminates these problems through automated, federated, and policy-aware tuning.

**Key components**
- **PerfPolicy Controller:** local loop adjusting query parameters.  
- **Telemetry Bus:** gathers metrics from SynaGraph and Scedge.  
- **Federated Trainer:** aggregates anonymized results at Knowlemesh Cloud.  
- **Policy Engine:** ensures tenant and compliance constraints are honored.

## 4. The PerfPolicy Model

```json
{
  "tenant": "acme-health",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-18T12:00:00Z",
  "alpha_sem": 0.6,
  "beta_graph": 0.2,
  "gamma_time": 0.15,
  "delta_prov": 0.05,
  "lambda_decay": 0.002,
  "top_k": 16,
  "tau": 0.72,
  "use_rerank": true,
  "metrics": { "p95_latency": 78, "hit_rate": 0.81, "fp_rate": 0.03, "fn_rate": 0.05 }
}
```

**Parameters tuned**
| Name | Function |
|------|-----------|
| `top_k` | Number of ANN neighbors retrieved. |
| `œÑ` | Confidence threshold for acceptance. |
| `Œª` | Temporal decay constant controlling freshness. |
| `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥` | Weighting factors for semantic, graph, temporal, and provenance scores. |
| `use_rerank` | Cross-encoder re-ranking toggle. |

## 5. The Self-Tuning Loop

```pseudo
every 60s per tenant:
  metrics = collect_metrics()
  if metrics.p95_latency > 80ms: policy.top_k -= 4
  if metrics.fn_rate > 0.08:     policy.top_k += 4
  policy.tau = clamp(policy.tau + (metrics.fp_rate*0.02 - metrics.fn_rate*0.01), 0.6, 0.9)
  policy.lambda = clamp(policy.lambda + (metrics.stale_flags*0.001 - metrics.long_tail_hits*0.0005), 0.0005, 0.01)
  save(policy)
```

Each node executes its own optimization loop, learning from live traffic.  
Global rollups aggregate trends to seed default configurations for new tenants.

---

## 6. Learning Methods

| Strategy | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Heuristic (PID-like)** | Simple feedback controller keeps metrics within thresholds. |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Rewards stable parameter sets that meet latency/recall SLAs. |
| **Federated Learning** | Shares model weights or hyperparameters across nodes without sharing data. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Detects data or model drift by monitoring variance in PerfPolicy deltas. |

---

## 7. Federation Model

- Each node maintains a **local SeTGIN agent**.  
- Agents exchange summarized parameter updates through **Knowlemesh Cloud**.  
- The cloud aggregates statistics but never raw data (privacy by design).  
- Nodes subscribe to updates relevant to their workloads and compliance zones.  

This creates a **Federated Control Loop**‚Äîself-tuning at both local and global scales.

---

## 8. Security & Governance

- **Signed Policies:** all PerfPolicy updates signed with tenant key.  
- **Audit Trail:** full history of parameter evolution stored in event log.  
- **Safe Bounds:** clamping and sandboxed testing before promotion.  
- **Rollback Support:** revert to previous policy on anomaly detection.  

---

## 9. Expected Benefits

| Metric | Static Graph | With SeTGIN |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| p95 Latency | 110 ms | **<70 ms** |
| Recall (Top-10) | 0.82 | **0.88** |
| Freshness Decay Error | 12 % | **<5 %** |
| Admin Tuning Overhead | Manual | **Zero (automated)** |
| GPU/Compute Savings | ‚Äî | **~25 % reduction** |

## 10. Integration Points

- **SynaGraph Core:** exposes `PerfPolicy` API for tuning internal indexes.  
- **Scedge PoPs:** feed hit/miss and latency metrics back into SeTGIN.  
- **Knowlemesh Cloud:** hosts federated training and global default policy store.  
- **CCP Capsules:** carry performance context for cross-node optimization.

## 11. Future Research

1. **Dynamic HNSW Re-parameterization** ‚Äì auto-tune `M` and `ef_search`.  
2. **Predictive Edge Warming** ‚Äì pre-load Scedge caches based on forecasted demand.  
3. **Adaptive Sharding** ‚Äì rebalance graph partitions dynamically.  
4. **Cross-Tenant Transfer Learning** ‚Äì anonymized sharing of PerfPolicy models.  
5. **Cognitive Load Balancing** ‚Äì route queries to the most ‚Äúawake‚Äù node (lowest latency/decay).

## 12. Conclusion

**SeTGIN** makes Memophor‚Äôs Knowledge Mesh truly self-aware.  
Every node learns from experience, automatically tuning itself for optimal performance, cost, and reliability.  
In combination with SynaGraph, Scedge, and Knowlemesh, SeTGIN turns the mesh into an intelligent, evolving organism‚Äîcapable of optimizing its own knowledge flow.
