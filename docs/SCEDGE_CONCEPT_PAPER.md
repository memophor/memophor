### *A Concept Paper by Memophor Labs*

### Abstract

Scedge introduces a new paradigm in AI infrastructure — a **semantic, policy-aware cache layer deployed at the network edge**.  
Unlike traditional CDNs or inference accelerators, Scedge stores and serves **knowledge**, not files or byte streams.  
By caching previously computed answers, templates, and context capsules close to where AIs operate, Scedge reduces redundant GPU inference, improves response latency by orders of magnitude, and forms the edge layer of the **Federated Knowledge Mesh**.

### 1. Introduction

Modern large language models (LLMs) perform billions of redundant computations daily.  
Identical or near-identical queries are repeatedly processed by GPU clusters, wasting energy, compute, and time.  
Current caching systems (HTTP CDNs, vector DBs, RAG frameworks) operate on **syntactic** keys, unaware of meaning, context, or policy.

**Scedge** bridges this gap with a **smart cache on the edge** — a system that recognizes semantic equivalence, enforces tenant policy, and integrates directly with Memophor’s SynaGraph and Knowlemesh platforms.  
It allows AI systems to serve known answers instantly while maintaining security, provenance, and compliance.

### 2. Problem Statement

| Challenge | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Redundant inference** | LLMs recompute similar answers millions of times per day. |
| **Latency** | Edge users experience multi-second roundtrips to centralized models. |
| **Cost** | GPU operations dominate cloud AI expenses. |
| **Compliance** | Existing CDNs lack awareness of PHI/PII or tenant-specific rules. |
| **Context fragmentation** | No unified mechanism to share computed knowledge across agents or organizations. |

---

### 3. Architecture Overview

**Scedge** operates as a distributed network of **Points of Presence (PoPs)** — lightweight nodes positioned geographically near users or data centers.

Each PoP performs:
- **Semantic caching** – storing artifacts by meaning (intent + slots + tenant + policy).  
- **Graph-aware invalidation** – syncs with SynaGraph to purge or supersede stale knowledge.  
- **Template rendering** – dynamic answers built from cached templates + runtime variables.  
- **Policy enforcement** – tenant and compliance scopes applied before serving.

**Core APIs**
| Method | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `GET /lookup` | Fetch cached artifact using semantic key. |
| `POST /store` | Push artifact from origin (Knowlemesh). |
| `POST /purge` | Invalidate by hash, provenance, or policy. |

Latency target: **p50 < 50 ms**, Token reduction: **≥ 70 %**, Availability: **99.99 %**.

### 4. Semantic Caching Model

**Cache key =**
```
intent + slots + tenant + policy + locale + model_version + content_version
```

Near-duplicates detected via small **ANN index (HNSW)** on embeddings.

Artifacts stored as:
```json
{
  "answer": "text or template",
  "policy": {"tenant":"acme","hipaa":true},
  "provenance": [{"source":"doc://handbook#42"}],
  "metrics": {"_score":0.91,"generated_at":"2025-10-18"},
  "ttl_sec":259200
}
```

### 5. Integration with the Knowledge Mesh

Scedge PoPs link directly with the Federated Knowledge Mesh:
- Receive **CCP capsules** from nearby SynaGraph nodes.
- Participate in **event replay** (`SUPERSEDE`, `REVOKE_CAPSULE`).
- Enforce tenant-scoped encryption and policy propagation.

When Agent A computes an answer →  
SynaGraph stores it → Knowlemesh validates → Scedge PoPs near relevant tenants are updated.  
Agent B later requests similar context → local PoP serves it instantly.

---

### 6. Security & Compliance

- **Tenant KMS encryption.**  
- **JWT / HMAC auth** between PoPs and origin.  
- **Policy tags** (HIPAA, GDPR) enforced at edge.  
- **Immutable provenance log** for all serves.  
- **No-cache defaults** for PHI unless tenant opt-in.

### 7. Prototype Results (Projected)

| Metric | Baseline (GPU Inference) | With Scedge |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Average latency | 2.8 s | 45 ms |
| Token cost per Q&A | $0.033 | $0.005 |
| GPU energy usage | 1.0× | 0.1× |
| Cache hit rate (after 1 month) | — | 80–90 % |

### 8. Future Research

1. **Trust Scoring for PoPs** – weight cache reliability via signed feedback.  
2. **Edge Learning** – micro-models trained on cached data for auto-rephrase.  
3. **Encrypted Caching (Zero-Trust)** – serve content without exposing plaintext.  
4. **Dynamic Topology** – adaptive PoP mesh reconfiguration based on latency and load.  
5. **Federated Observability** – distributed tracing and metrics pipeline.

---

### 9. Conclusion

Scedge extends Memophor’s Federated Knowledge Mesh to the physical edge, turning AI inference into a **cachable, federated, and policy-compliant process**.  
By combining semantics, security, and performance, Scedge represents a new category in AI infrastructure — the **Knowledge CDN**.

### Next Steps
1. Draft simulation plan for PoP hit-rate & token cost savings.  
2. Build Rust prototype for PoP services (`lookup`, `store`, `purge`).  
3. Collect benchmark data for inclusion in v1.0 paper.
