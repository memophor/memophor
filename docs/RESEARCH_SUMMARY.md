## 1. Purpose
Memophor Labs investigates the scientific and engineering foundations of **persistent, federated AI memory**.  
Our goal: build a **Knowledge Mesh** that allows intelligent systems to store, exchange, and evolve understanding safely, efficiently, and autonomously.

## 2. Core Research Themes

| Theme | Description | Lead Components |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Federated Knowledge Mesh (FKM)** | Distributed, policy-scoped network of memory nodes replacing central routers. | SynaGraph, Knowlemesh |
| **Context Capsule Protocol (CCP)** | Open standard for context packaging and AI-to-AI memory transfer. | CCP, Scedge |
| **Edge Caching for AI (Scedge)** | Semantic, policy-aware cache that bypasses GPU inference when knowledge is known. | Scedge PoPs |
| **Self-Tuning Graph Intelligence** | Autonomous performance optimization through telemetry feedback loops. | PerfPolicy in SynaGraph |
| **Semantic Routing & Discovery** | Content-based routing across federated graphs using embeddings and trust scores. | Knowlemesh registry |
| **Temporal Memory & Decay Models** | Dynamic weighting of knowledge freshness and reinforcement. | SynaGraph temporal layer |
| **Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Sharing** | Encryption, tenant isolation, and auditability in federated memory. | Knowlemesh policies, CCP signatures |
| **AI Context Transfer & Interoperability** | Mechanisms for different models to reuse reasoning via Capsules. | CCP over MCP integration |

## 3. Key Research Questions

| Area | Question |
|------|-----------|
| **Federation Topology** | How do SynaGraph nodes self-organize without a central router? |
| **Semantic Routing** | What metrics define ‚Äúclosest‚Äù knowledge: embedding distance, trust, latency, or policy match? |
| **Consistency** | Which CRDT or delta-graph model best supports eventual consistency across federated graphs? |
| **Policy Propagation** | How can tenant and compliance metadata travel securely with context Capsules? |
| **Capsule Encoding** | Optimal format for cross-AI context (JSON, CBOR, Protobuf)? |
| **Trust & Identity** | How to authenticate nodes and agents in a decentralized network (PKI, DID, token exchange)? |
| **Edge Economics** | What caching strategies maximize GPU savings while preserving freshness? |
| **Learning Feedback** | Can capsule reuse data train smaller edge models without retraining central LLMs? |
| **Zero-Trust Memory** | Can we design encrypted Capsules verifiable without revealing contents? |
